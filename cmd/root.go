	Use:   "dfs",
	Short: "A distributed file system",
	Long: `DFS (Distributed File System) is a scalable and fault-tolerant
storage system designed to handle large-scale file storage across multiple nodes.

Features:
- Supports large file uploads with automatic chunking and replication.
- Ensures data availability with a distributed and redundant architecture.
- Provides resumable uploads for reliability in case of network failures.
- Offers efficient load balancing and dynamic node management.
- Implements a high-performance key-value store for metadata.

This CLI tool allows you to manage nodes, upload/download files, and monitor
the health of the distributed system.`,
